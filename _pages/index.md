DiveRSE is a series of talks and related activities including discussion and
panel sessions designed to support and raise awareness of Equity, Diversity and
Inclusion (EDI) challenges and successes within the research software
community.

The series started in March 2022, linked to the "[_Vive la diff√©rence -
research software engineers_](https://www.researchsoft.org/events/2022-04/)"
workshop that was hosted at the [Lorentz
Centre](https://www.lorentzcenter.nl/about-us.html) in 
The Netherlands in April 2022.
