#### Overview

In our next event in the 2023 DiveRSE series, **Ella Kaye** (Research Software
Engineer, University of Warwick) and **Malvika Sharan** (Senior Researcher – Open Research at the Alan Turing Institute and co-lead of The Turing Way)
will converse about their experiences in/with the RSE community, as well as
both the challenges and successes they've encountered when working to improve
EDIA. In a wide-ranging discussion, they will also consider why all RSEs should
be engaged with EDIA and how they can offer support, as well as broader
philosophical issues around epistemic justice. There will be time for questions
and further discussion.
