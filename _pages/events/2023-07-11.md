#### Seminar Details

Our next speaker in the DiveRSE series is **Mariann (Maz) Hardey**, Professor
of Digital Culture, Technology and Business at 
Durham University Business School. Mariann is also a member of Advanced Research
Computing (ARC) at Durham, where her role supports widening participation and
accessibility in computing. She is passionate about self-development and
learning, with a focus on representation among business leaders and
practitioners in the technology sector. One of her latest books “The Culture of
Women in Tech” forms part of the Master Class curriculum of the UK Government
Digital Service to promote employment reform and inclusivity. Mariann has been
researching and working with tech organisations for over twenty years. 

In her talk, Mariann will focus on the ‘Whoddunit’ behind Equality, Diversity
and Inclusion (EDI/DEI) in the tech workplace. To best serve these fundamental
principles, one must first understand the mechanics behind it.
