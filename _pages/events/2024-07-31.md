#### Overview

In our next event in the DiveRSE series, **Ella Kaye** (Research Software
Engineer, University of Warwick) and **Malvika Sharan** (Senior Researcher – Open
Research at the Alan Turing Institute and co-lead of The Turing Way) will
converse about their experiences in/with the RSE community, as well as both the
challenges and successes they’ve encountered when working to improve EDIA. They
will discuss the importance and difficulties of community-building and why it
matters from an EDIA perspective. They will also consider the intersectionality
between developing an RSE identity and their identities as members of groups
under-represented in the broader RSE community. There will be time for
questions and further discussion.

#### About the speakers

[Ella Kaye](https://ellakaye.co.uk/) is a Research Software Engineer in the
Department of Statistics at the University of Warwick, working with [Dr Heather
Turner](https://warwick.ac.uk/fac/sci/statistics/staff/academic-research/turner/)
on her fellowship “Sustainability and EDI (Equality, Diversity and Inclusion)
in the R Project”. She is interested in Open Source Software and
community-building in the R and RSE communities with a focus on EDIA. In
particular, she runs [rainbowR](https://rainbowr.netlify.app/), a community
that supports, promotes, and connects LGBTQ+ people who code in the R language.

[Malvika Sharan](https://malvikasharan.github.io/) is a Senior Researcher for
the Tools, Practices and Systems research programme at The Alan Turing
Institute, London. With a focus on Open Research, she leads a team of community
managers and co-leads The Turing Way project that aims to make data science
reproducible, collaborative, ethical and inclusive for researchers around the
globe.

Malvika is a co-founder of Open Life Science, a mentoring and training
programme that empowers researchers to gain an understanding of open science
principles, build collaborations with experts and adopt best practices in the
context of their communities. She is also a Software Sustainability Institute
fellow, Open Bioinformatics Foundation board member and an active contributor
of open source projects.
