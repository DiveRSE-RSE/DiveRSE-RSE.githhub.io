#### Abstract

"Lessons from Diversity, Equity and Inclusion (DEI) in open source software (OSS)"

This presentation will explore why increasing diversity, equity, and inclusion is integral to OSS’s future,
and will cover topics including the code of conduct’s role as a moderation tool, the different OSS career
trajectories between men and women, and the unique experiences of contributors coming from
under-represented and vulnerable backgrounds, particularly gender non-conforming contributors.

#### About the speaker

Hana is a PhD student at the University of Texas-Austin in Information Studies, advised by Dr. James Howison,
and is a continuing research assistant at Carnegie Mellon University also advised by Dr. Laura Dabbish.
She is interested in topics related to increasing DEI in OSS and designing interventions to support
contributors from under-represented backgrounds.
