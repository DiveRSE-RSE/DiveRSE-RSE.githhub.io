#### Overview

We're delighted to welcome Mary Ann Leung, Ph.D. as our inaugural speaker in
the DiveRSE talk series.

Following the talk, there will be a chance to join a faciliated discussion in
breakout rooms providing an excellent opportunity to chat with Research
Software Engineers and researchers from around the world.

This interactive talk is being co-hosted with and supported by the <a
href="https://society-rse.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">
Society of Research Software Engineering</a>. Register for this talk

#### Abstract

The [Vive la différence - research software
engineers](https://www.researchsoft.org/events/2022-04/) workshop aims to
explore ways to reframe research software engineering (RSE) placing diversity,
equity, and inclusion (DEI) as a central organizing principle.  RSEs work in
highly inter and multi-disciplinary environments, where they must be adept at
“speaking” multiple languages, e.g., programming and domain languages.  RSEs may
have been trained in computer science, a domain science, mathematics, or an
engineering discipline.  Given the technical diversity, one might expect
research software communities to welcome social diversity, creating an ideal
ecosystem for the placing DEI as a central organizing principle.  However,
while research indicates that social diversity results in greater innovation,
research software itself, as a growing multidisciplinary field spanning the
globe and representing a diverse spectrum of technical domains, remains largely
homogeneous. 

This session explores what it takes to achieve DEI, also known as
equity, diversity, inclusion (EDI) and justice, equity, diversity, inclusion
(JEDI) and how reframing DEI within RSE could increase innovation and developer
productivity.  We will also consider how cultivating respect and embracing
difference could help to normalize inclusion.

#### About the speaker

Mary Ann Leung is the founder and President of [Sustainable Horizons
Institute](https://shinstitute.org/), a nonprofit organization dedicated to
developing the computational science and engineering workforce and promoting
diversity, equity, and inclusion.  Her research interests span computational
quantum mechanics, quantum computing, high performance computing, workforce
development, diversity, and inclusion. Leung serves as an Editor for the
Computing in Science and Engineering (CiSE) Magazine Diversity and Inclusion
department.  She performs a variety of community activities including serving
on the study committee for the Congressionally mandated National Academies
Assessment of the NASA University Leadership Initiative.  Dr. Leung holds B.A.,
M.S. and PhD. degrees in Computational Physical Chemistry.
