#### Abstract

"Reimagining software processes and practices for an inclusive RSE"

The software industry currently lacks diversity despite many initiatives to improve diversity and inclusion. In this talk, Dr Kelly Blincoe will reflect on the software tools, practices, and working culture, and how they might contribute to this problem. Blincoe will describe a study that used a destructive criticism lens to examine software code review feedback. Software code review is a practice where code is peer reviewed and negative feedback is often delivered. I will discuss differences in perceptions, frequency, and impact of destructive criticism across genders and reflect on what we can learn from these findings.
