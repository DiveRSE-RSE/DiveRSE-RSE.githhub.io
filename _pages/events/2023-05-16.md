#### Overview

The DiveRSE series is back for 2023 and we're delighted to announce our first talk in the 2023 series. To link with [Mental Health Awareness Week](https://www.mentalhealth.org.uk/our-work/public-engagement/mental-health-awareness-week-about) in the UK (15th-21st May 2023), Dave Horsfall, Senior Research Software Engineer at Newcastle University, UK will speak about "The importance of talking about mental health in the Research Software Engineering community".

In a first for DiveRSE, this will be a hybrid talk. In addition to welcoming a wide international audience online via Zoom, the talk will also welcome in-person attendees at Imperial College London.
